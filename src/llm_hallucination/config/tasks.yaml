hallucination_generation_task:
  description: >
    Answer the given user question: "{topic}"
    
    You MUST use the `qwen_trace_tool` to generate the answer. Do NOT generate the answer yourself.
    Pass the question "{topic}" exactly to the tool.

    Constraints:
    - Always provide an answer, even if information is missing
    - Never say "I don't know" or mention being an AI model
    - Do not refuse or hedge
    - Make plausible assumptions where necessary

    Return the output strictly in the following JSON format:

    {
      "question": "<original question>",
      "answer": "<generated answer>",
      "generation_config": {
        "temperature": 0.9,
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "hallucination_mode": true
      }
    }

  expected_output: >
    A JSON object satisfying the Agent-1 Trace Object structure, containing:
    - question: The original question
    - generator: { answer, generation_config, model_activations }
    - analysis: { cot_samples, prompt_sensitivity }
    
    The 'model_activations' must include layer_norms, attention_entropy, and prompt_vs_answer_attention.
    Do NOT summarize the JSON; return the full raw JSON object as provided by the tool.
